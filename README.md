# Web-Scraping-Data
This data science project involves automated data collection from a website, primarily using web scraping techniques. Web scraping, an automated method of extracting data from websites, serves various purposes such as gathering business information, analyzing social media trends, or compiling real estate listings. Initially, the project focused on scraping a single page of a car website to extract details like car model, price, reviews, mileage, and dealer information. After cleaning the data, particularly the review counts, the project evolved to include pagination. By adapting the scraping code to handle multiple pages, data from ten pages of the website was extracted. This involved splitting the URL into three segments: a static part consistent across pages, a dynamic segment for changing page numbers, and another static portion. This refinement allowed for a more comprehensive data collection.
